# Fairness in Machine Learning

## [Frontier of Computational Journalism (JOUR J6002)](http://compjournalism.com)

I created this as the final project for my Frontiers class under [Prof. Jonathan Stray](http://jonathanstray.com).

The data and part of the code for this project was taken from the 
[ProPublica's Compas Analysis Repository](https://github.com/propublica/compas-analysis) as well as a 
[class assignment](https://github.com/jstray/compjournalism2018/blob/master/fairness-tradeoffs-homework.ipynb) on the same. 
You can find the final visualization [here](/frontiers/index). A report on the inspiration and methodology of the project can be 
found [here](https://github.com/pankhurikumar23/computational-journalism/blob/master/Report%20-%20Fairness%20in%20Machine%20Learning.pdf).

I'd love feedback on the project!
