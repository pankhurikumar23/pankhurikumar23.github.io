				While various surveys document the performance of villages, block, districts and states, there are no official surveys at the Lok Sabha constituency level. This is an attempt to fill this gap. Besides providing an overall picture, the interactive portal can also be of assistance to monitor progress in each constituency.
			</p>
			<p>
				Data for the portal have been extracted from the National Family Health Survey, 2015-16 (NFHS-4), the 71st round of the National Sample Survey (2014), and the Unified District Information System for Education (U-DISE), 2015-16.
			</p>

				While a Lok Sabha constituency may span multiple districts, state assembly constituencies do not. First, district-level data were matched with state assembly constituencies. Since Lok Sabha constituencies comprise several assembly segments, data derived for the latter were extrapolated to the former.
			</p>
			<p>
				Since the sampling can vary across and within districts, these data may not match a constituency-level survey if and when conducted, but are indicative to infer where a constituency stands in comparison to the national average.
