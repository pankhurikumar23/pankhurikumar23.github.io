# India's Case for Women Empowerment

## [Data Visualization (ARCH A4892)](http://agneschang.net/gsapp-dataviz-archhum/)

I created this as the final project for my Data Visualization class under [Prof. Agnes Chang](http://agneschang.net/).

The data for this project was taken from the [National Family Health Survey 4 (2015-2016)](http://rchiips.org/NFHS/nfhs4.shtml). 
You can find the final visualization [here](https://pankhurikumar23.github.io/dataviz/assignment7/view1.html) and the story 
outlining the making of this project [here](https://medium.com/@pankhurikumar23/indias-case-for-women-empowerment-b46674cbd445).

I'd love feedback on the project!
