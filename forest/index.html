                        The map shows the location of 2,053 projects out of a total of 2,115 projects that the <a href="http://moef.gov.in">Ministry</a> 
                        of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) granted Environment Clearances to between July 2014 and March 2020. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The maps also show Protected Areas (PAs) i.e. areas that enjoy a higher degree of protection to preserve their biodiversity 
                        (flora, fauna, ecosystems, etc) and for which human occupation is legally limited. National parks, wildlife sanctuaries, 
                        conservation reserves are all examples of PAs. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        India’s four biodiversity hotspots are also shown on the map for reference; these are internationally recognised as being among 
                        the Earth’s 36 most biologically rich regions.

                        <b>What is an EC:</b> An Environment Clearance (EC) is an approval required before an organisation can start any infrastructure, 
                        mining, processing or manufacturing undertaking that may be potentially detrimental to the environment. The clearance is granted 
                        either by the Centre or the state depending on the type of project it is. In addition to an EC, some projects may require 
                        wildlife and forest clearances.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>How to use the map:</b> Explore the location and types of projects granted EC since 2014, by using the filters alongside the 
                        map. Discover which projects have been approved in each state, year, industry and their distance from nearby PAs.

                            Location coordinates have been used to map locations for 1,378 of the 2,053 projects that received ECs. Location coordinates were unavailable, or noticeably inaccurate (outside India, for example) for 795 projects. These have been plotted as per the provided tehsil information. Certain tehsils will therefore appear to have a large number of overlapping projects. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The remaining 62 projects have not been plotted on the map. These are projects for which location coordinates and tehsil information is missing in the Parivesh data.

                            672 PAs were mapped based on information available on the UN-supported <a href="https://www.protectedplanet.net/search?q=India">
                            Protected Planet</a> website. The 4 biodiversity hotspots present in India were collected from the

                            to be. Each project has been manually copied from the website and there could be inaccuracies. Kindly let us know if you see a

                            Reporting for this project was done between the second half of 2019 and early 2020. IndiaSpend travelled across
                             the country for four months, reporting from Uttar Pradesh to Karnataka, as a part of a year-long investigation on how some of 
                             India’s infrastructure projects are imperilling the environment. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Our ground reports will be added to the map and as and when they are published at <a href="https://www.indiaspend.com/">IndiaSpend.com</a>
