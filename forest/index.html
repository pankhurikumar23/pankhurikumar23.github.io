                        In this map we have plotted Environment Clearances granted by the Centre between 2014 and March 2020. We have also mapped 
                        <a href="http://www.wiienvis.nic.in/Database/Protected_Area_854.aspx">India’s Protected Areas (PAs)</a> -- national parks, 
                        wildlife sanctuaries, conservation reserves and community reserves.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Protected Areas are areas in which human occupation is limited under the law and home to many endangered species. They are 
                        meant to be conserved, but can be opened up for infrastructure projects under special circumstances, with permission from 
                        the government and where the wildlife involved is set to benefit. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Certain categories of infrastructure projects which could damage the environment require environment clearances (ECs) before 
                        they can go ahead. Some projects could also need forest and wildlife clearance in addition to ECs, depending on their location. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Projects that stand to cause excessive damage to the environment could be denied a clearance, while others are allowed to 
                        proceed only after meeting certain conditions. Depending on the type of the project, the clearance is either granted by the 
                        centre or the state. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Out of the 2115 projects that were collected, 2058 have been represented on the map. 57 of them could not be represented on 
                        the map due to lack of location data or because data was incorrectly entered at source. For approximately 680 projects, 
                        coordinates were either not explicitly available, or they mapped to places outside of India. These have been mapped by the 
                        tehsil provided in the data.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        As data for this project was manually collected from the Parivesh website, there could be some errors in the data represented 
                        in this map. For example, certain projects map outside of the state they are supposed to be in. 
                        <br>
                        We have followed the process of relying on location coordinates wherever possible. If these coordinates were unavailable, 
                        or noticeably wrong (outside India), we have defaulted to mapping these projects to the provided tehsil. Due to this, 
                        certain tehsils will see a large number of overlapping projects.
                        <br>
                        If location coordinates as well as tehsil information was unavailable, the projects are not shown on this map. 57 such 
                        projects exist. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        47 out of the 2058 projects where data was able to be collected are located within PAs. A further 275 are located within 10km 
                        of a PA boundary, or the ‘buffer zone’ - an area where human activity is supposed to be limited.

                            Reporting for this project was done between the second half of 2019 and early 2020. IndiaSpend travelled across the country 
                            for four months, reporting from Uttar Pradesh to Karnataka, as a part of a year-long investigation on how some of India’s 
                            infrastructure projects will destroy the environment. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            We spoke to local communities, policymakers, economists and legal experts to make sense of the choices that need to be made 
                            as India’s 1.3 billion population exerts pressure on its resources.  
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Reporting for this series was supported by the <a href="https://pulitzercenter.org">Pulitzer Center for Crisis Reporting</a>
                             and we are greatly indebted to them.
