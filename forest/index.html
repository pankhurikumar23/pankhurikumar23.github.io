                        <b>What:</b> An Environment Clearance (EC) is an approval required before an organisation can start any infrastructure, mining, 
                        processing or manufacturing undertaking that may be potentially detrimental to the environment. The clearance is granted either 
                        by the Centre or the state depending on the type of project it is. In addition to an EC, some projects may require wildlife and 
                        forest clearances.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>The map:</b> The map shows the location of 2,057 projects out of a total of 2,115 projects that the <a href="http://moef.gov.in">
                        Ministry</a> of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) granted ECs to between July 2014 and March 2020. The maps also 
                        show Protected Areas (PAs) i.e. areas that enjoy a higher degree of protection to preserve their biodiversity (flora, fauna, 
                        ecosystems, etc) and for which human occupation is legally limited. National parks, wildlife sanctuaries, conservation reserves 
                        are all examples of PAs.

                            Location coordinates have been used to map locations for 1,378 of the 2,058 projects that received ECs. Location coordinates were 
                            unavailable, or noticeably inaccurate (outside India, for example) for 680 projects. These have been plotted as per the provided 
                            tehsil information. Certain tehsils will therefore appear to have a large number of overlapping projects.

                            The remaining 57 projects have not been plotted on the map. These are projects for which location coordinates and tehsil information 
                            is missing in the Parivesh data.

                            riddled with errors. For instance, certain projects are mapped in a neighbouring state and not the state in which it is supposed 
                            to be. Each project has been manually copied from the website and there could be inaccuracies. Kindly let us know if you see a

                            Reporting for this project was done between the second half of 2019 and early 2020. IndiaSpend travelled 
                            across the country for four months, reporting from Uttar Pradesh to Karnataka, as a part of a year-long investigation on how 
                            some of Indiaâ€™s infrastructure projects are imperilling the environment.
